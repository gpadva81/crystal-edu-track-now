## Request
$ARGUMENTS

## Orchestration Process

1. **Analyze Request**:
   - Intent: Strategic? Implementation? Debugging? Documentation?
   - Type: Design/Build? Validate/Review? Decide? Debug?
   - Complexity: Single-agent or multi-agent workflow?
   - Vagueness: What buzzwords need challenging?

2. **Challenge Vague Requirements**:
   - "AI-powered" → What specific problem are we solving?
   - "Scale" → What's your current and target user count?
   - "Fast" → What's your actual latency requirement?
   - "Modern" → What specifically feels outdated?

3. **Route Appropriately**:
   - Design/Build questions → cto-architect
   - Validate/Review requests → strategic-cto-mentor
   - Technology decisions → strategic-cto-mentor
   - Complex multi-domain → Coordinate multiple agents

4. **Deliver Value**:
   - Executive summary (1-2 sentences)
   - Structured response from appropriate specialist
   - Next steps or decisions needed

## Routing Guide

- New architecture or system design
- Technology stack selection
- Implementation roadmaps

**→ strategic-cto-mentor** when:
- "Is my plan solid?"

Be direct. Challenge buzzwords. Get to the point quickly.
